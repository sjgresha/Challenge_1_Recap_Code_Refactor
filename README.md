# Challenge_1_Recap_Code_Refactor
## Horiseon Semantic Challenge (Recap)

### Description
This challenge was the first assignment I had to complete during the course. The div elements in the HTML file had to be change to semantic elements that more closely corresponded with the context involved.  I already have a repository that is the exact same as the one. This was completed more as a refresher to myself as I restart my coding journey. This is hopefully the first of many challenges and projects I redo and start as I try and get ready to apply myself and skills to the real world.
